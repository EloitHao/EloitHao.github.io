# Why aren't my comments shown on the page?

这个网站对我来说*重要。我不想因为别人的评论而惹上任何麻烦。**因此，所有评论都将经过审核**。您的评论可能需要几天时间才能最终显示在网站上。不过，我保留编辑或删除不符合标准的评论的权利。查看 [comm(enit\|it) system](https://commentit.io/) 如何工作 [here](https://commentit.io/faq).
# Do you read the comments?

**Yes**. All comments on any of the post, no matter how long ago it was posted, will be visible to me the second you posted it. 

I read your comments because your comments matter to me.

I get encouragement from comments ( this is the main reason I opened the comment section).

Besides, I am aware that I will be probably making *a lot* mistakes on posts. Some maybe grammatic, some might be of facts. Enabling comment is the most effective way for me to correct them. 

# What are the guidelines for posting a comment?

Well, there really isn't much. **You can be a resource for your fellow readers and I sincerely hope that you’ll use our comment section to do that**. Just follow your common sense and you should be good. For those who really need a document, here are the rules.

1. **Stay on point.** When making a comment, try not to go off-topic. Also, try to keep them short and clear.

2. **Show respect.** I encourage and appreciate thoughtful debates. Just make sure that when you disagree with the author or another commenter, you do so in a respectful and courteous manner.
